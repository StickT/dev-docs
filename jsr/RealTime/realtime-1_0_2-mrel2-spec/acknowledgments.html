<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>The reader should consider this work truly a collaborative effort. Many people 

  contributed in diverse ways. Unlike most traditional published books this work 

  is the result of effort and contribution from engineers, executives, administrators, 

  marketing and product managers, industry consultants, and university faculty members

  spread across more than two dozen companies and organizations from around the 

  globe. It is also the result of a new and unique method for developing software, 

  The Java Community Process.</p>

<p>We'll start at the beginning. Many of the technical contributors came together 

  at a series of forums conceived and hosted by Lisa Carnahan at the National 

  Institute for Standards and Technology. One of the authors, Greg Bollella, was 

  instrumental, along with Lisa, in the early establishment of the organization 

  of the future authors. He thanks his managers at IBM, Ruth Taylor, Rod Smith 

  and Pat Sueltz, for (in their words) being low-maintenance managers and for 

  allowing Greg the freedom to pursue his goal.</p>

<p>The Java Community Process was developed at Sun Microsystems by Jim Mitchell, Ken Urquhart, and others to allow and promote the broad involvement of the computer industry in the development of the Java(tm) Platform. We thank them and all those at Sun and other companies who reviewed the initial proposals of the process. Vicki Shipkowitz the embedded Java product manager at Sun has also helped the Real-Time for Java Expert Group with logistics around demonstrations.<h2>Acknowledgements for edition 1.0.1.</h2>
<p>The RTSJ Maintenance Lead, Doug Locke, and the Tech Lead, Peter Dibble, thank 
  the numerous contributors to this interpretive effort:
<ul>
  <li>The original expert groups, especially Greg Bollella, the founder and spiritual 
    leader of this effort</li>
  <li>The members of the Technical Interpretation Committee, Rudy Belliardi, Greg 
    Bollella, Ben Brosgol, and Andy Wellings. These spent many hours of discussion 
    and contributed to editing chapters. Rudy revised the time, timers, and clocks 
    material. Ben revised the synchronization material. Andy revised the Asynchrony 
    chapter, the threads chapter and the scheduling chapter. Greg revised the 
    introduction.</li>
  <li>David Holmes read and carefully critiqued this work several times as it 
    was in progress.</li>
  <li>The contributions of Reference Implementation team at TimeSys cannot be 
    overstated. They converted the ideas of the original expert group into working 
    code and told us when things could not be implemented. Their implementation 
    and their suggestions on improvements to the spec were critical. Many people 
    have passed through the team, but the primary contributors were Pratik Solanki, 
    Scott Robbins, and Dio deNizVillasenor.</li>
  <li>Many early users and implementors of the RTSJ have contributed suggestions, 
    bug reports, and other friendly criticism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgements for the first edition</h2>
<p>The Real-Time for Java Expert Group comprises a primary engineer and consultant 
  teams. This authors of this work are the primary engineers and we sincerely 
  thank the consultants for their effort during the early design phase and for 
  reviewing various drafts. 
<p>Greg Bollella would like to personally thank his dissertation advisor Kevin Jeffay, 

  for advice during this effort.

<p>We thank Robin Coron and Feng Liu, administrative assistants at IBM and Sun 
  Microsystems for their logistical support. </p>
