		<h1>Changes from the First Edition</h1>
		<p>This document describes the API changes made to the Real-Time Specification for Java after its 1.0 release in 2002.</p>
		<h2>Version 1.0.2</h2>
		<p>Version 1.0.2 is primarily a set of clarifications and changes derived from exchanges with several teams implementing RTSJ.  Version 1.0.2 also tightens the specification a little where those changes will not greatly harm implementability.</p>
		<h3>Finalization</h3>
		<p>The revised finalization semantics attempt to clarify the algorithm for finalizing objects in a scope in passes until there are no more finalizable objects or the finalizers create a schedulable object that references the scope.  The revised semantics also require the schedulable object exiting the scope when it becomes finalizable to run the finalizers.</p>
		<h3>Cost enforcement</h3>
		<p>The concept of <em>deferred suspension</em> has been added to cost enforcement for schedulable objects, and <em>enforced priority</em> has been defined for processing groups.</p>
		<h3>AsyncEventHandler</h3>
		<p>A conflict between the 1.0.1 semantics, and the method documentation and RI was resolved by specifying that an async event handler's fire count is decremented before invoking <code>handleAsyncEvent.</code></p>
		<p>The semantics for the fire count manipulation methods have been specified for all callers.</p>
		<h3>Non-Default Initial Memory Area</h3>
		<p>Detailed semantics have been added for the treatment of non-default initial memory areas for real-time threads and async event handlers. This had ramifications in the scoped memory <code>joinAndEnter</code> methods.</p>
		<h3>AsynchronouslyInterruptedException</h3>
		<p><em>Interruptible blocking methods</em> are defined, as are the semantics for interrupting those methods.</p>
		<h3>Exceptions</h3>
		<p>In some cases where there was ambiguity about which exception should be thrown, the exception precedence has been clarified.</p>
		<h2>Version 1.0.1</h2>
		<p>The primary objective of the 1.0.1 version of the RTSJ was clarification. That clarification resulted in a nearly complete re-write of the semantics and requirements sections, but those revisions were not intended to express different semantics. They were intended to express the original semantics:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>More carefully and completely
			<li>More conveniently (also more redundantly. Some statements that were made once in the first edition of the RTSJ are now replaced with the method-by-method consequences of those statements.)
			<li>Without constraining the implementation except where that is necessary to achieve compatibility between implementations.
		</ul>
		<p>Deprecation in this version should be treated as emphatic advice to avoid the deprecated feature. In RTSJ 1.0.1, deprecation usually means that the semantics for a class or method may not be actively dangerous, but for various reasons its semantics cannot be clarified in a reasonable and unambiguous way. These methods (and one class) are not necessary, and they will almost certainly be entirely removed soon. In any case, their semantics are not well-defined, they cannot be adequately tested, and any application that values portability should not use them.</p>
		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>The processing group enforcement option has been separated from the cost enforcement option, and support for processing group deadline less than period has been made optional.</p>
		<p>A profile for development tools has been introduced. This permits a development tool to implement RTSJ classes without implementing all the RTSJ semantics.</p>
		<h2>Threads and Scheduling</h2>
		<p>As much as possible, semantics that relate to scheduling have been made attributes of the scheduler, this caused many semantics to move from the Threads chapter to the Scheduling chapter.</p>
		<h3>New Methods and Signature Changes</h3>
		<h4>RealtimeThread</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Added <code>MemoryArea getMemoryArea() </code>to return the initial memory area of the <code>RealtimeThread.</code> This method that was in the 1.0 reference implementation and the TCK, but was left out of the specification.
			<li>Changes to the operation of <code>setPriority</code> in<code> java.lang.Thread</code> are described.
			<li><code>waitForNextPeriod</code> is made <code>static</code> since it would be dangerous for a thread to invoke the method on any other thread.
			<li>Added <code>waitForNextPeriodInterruptible</code> because (especially for real-time systems) blocking methods should be interruptible.
			<li>Added two new <code>setIfFeasible</code> methods (See the Schedulable interface.)
		</ol>
		<h4>NoHeapRealtimeThread</h4>
		<p>None</p>
		<h4>Scheduler</h4>
		<p>Let <code>fireSchedulable</code> throw <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> because only specific classes (possibly no classes) that implement the <code>Schedulable</code> interface can be fired by any given scheduler.</p>
		<p>Add method</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>public abstract boolean setIfFeasible(Schedulable schedulable, SchedulingParameters scheduling, ReleaseParameters release, MemoryParameters memory, ProcessingGroupParameters group)</code>
		</ol>
		<p>The following methods were made abstract:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>public abstract boolean setIfFeasible (Schedulable&nbsp;schedulable, ReleaseParameters&nbsp;release, MemoryParameters&nbsp;memory)</code>
			<li><code>public abstract boolean setIfFeasible (Schedulable&nbsp;schedulable, ReleaseParameters&nbsp;release, MemoryParameters&nbsp;memory, ProcessingGroupParameters&nbsp;group)</code>
		</ol>
		<h4>Schedulable</h4>
		<p>A number of methods were consistently present in classes that implement <code>Schedulable</code> and should have been included in <code>Schedulable</code>. They were added to the<code> Schedulable</code> interface:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>boolean addIfFeasible()</code>,
			<li><code>boolean setIfFeasible(ReleaseParameters release, MemoryParameters memory), </code>
			<li><code>boolean setIfFeasible(ReleaseParameters release, MemoryParameters memory, ProcessingGroupParameters group),</code>
			<li><code>boolean setIfFeasible(ReleaseParameters release, ProcessingGroupParameters group)</code>
		</ol>
		<p>Two methods were added to improve the parallel construction of the Scheduler and the Schedulable interface. The new methods also make it possible to update the scheduling parameters considering feasibility:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>boolean setIfFeasible(SchedulingParameters sched,<br>
					ReleaseParameters release,<br>
					MemoryParameters memory)</code>
			<li><code>boolean setIfFeasible(SchedulingParameters sched,<br>
					ReleaseParameters release,<br>
					MemoryParameters memory,<br>
					ProcessingGroupParameters group)</code>
		</ol>
		<p><code>IllegalThreadStateException</code> was removed from the <code>throws</code> clause of the <code>setScheduler</code> methods because there is no case where that exception will be thrown.</p>
		<h4>ReleaseParameters</h4>
		<p><code>ReleaseParameters</code> now implements <code>Cloneable</code> and has a public <code>clone</code> method.</p>
		<h4>SchedulingParameters</h4>
		<p><code>SchedulingParameters</code> now implements <code>Cloneable</code> and has a public <code>clone</code> method.</p>
		<p>The constructor is changed to <code>protected</code> to match similar classes, such as <code>ReleaseParameters</code>.</p>
		<h4>PeriodicParameters</h4>
		<p>Two new constructors,</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>PeriodicParameters(RelativeTime period)</code>
			<li><code>PeriodicParameters(HighResolutionTime start, RelativeTime period)</code>
		</ol>
		<p>were added to conveniently support common patterns, and as pro-active support for a safety-critical specification.</p>
		<h4>ProcessingGroupParameters</h4>
		<p><code>ProcessingGroupParameters</code> now implements <code>Cloneable</code> and has a public <code>clone</code> method.</p>
		<h4>AperiodicParameters</h4>
		<p>The methods and constants that relate to the arrival time queue overflow behavior have been moved from <code>SporadicParameters</code> to <code>AperiodicParameters</code> because the arrival time queue is an aspect of aperiodic tasks. The implementation had to maintain the queue, but the application could not control it unless it used sporadic parameters. The list of moved methods and constants is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>String arrivalTimeQueueOverflowExcept</code>
			<li><code>String arrivalTimeQueueOverflowIgnore</code>
			<li><code>String arrivalTimeQueueOverflowReplace</code>
			<li><code>String arrivalTimeQueueOverflowSave</code>
			<li><code>int getInitialArrivalTimeQueueLength()</code>
			<li><code>void setInitialArrivalTimeQueueLength(int length)</code>
			<li><code>void setArrivalTimeQueueOverflowBehavior(String behavior)</code>
			<li><code>String getArrivalTimeQueueOverflowBehavior()</code>
		</ul>
		<p>A new constructor:</p>
		<p><code>AperiodParameters()</code></p>
		<p>has been added to make a common case easier to write, and to proactively support work on the safety critical Java specification.</p>
		<h4>SporadicParameters</h4>
		<p>The methods and constants listed as moved <i>to</i> <code>AperiodicParameters</code> are moved <i>from</i> <code>SporadicParameters</code>. They still appear in the sporadic parameters class, but now they are inherited from aperiodic parameters.</p>
		<p>A new constructor:</p>
		<p><code>SporadicParameters(RelativeTime minInterarrival)</code></p>
		<p>has been added to make a common case easier to write, and to proactively support work on the safety critical Java specification.</p>
		<h4>PriorityScheduler</h4>
		<p>The semantics for the <em>REPLACE</em> MIT violation policy for sporadic parameters has been revised to &quot;If the last event has not been processed revise its release time to the current time. This will alter the deadline at any time up to completion of its processing or the time it misses its deadline. <font color="#000000">If event processing for the replaced release has been completed or it has already missed its deadline, the behavior of the REPLACE policy is equivalent to IGNORE.</font>&quot;</p>
		<p>The <code>fireSchedulable</code> method is permitted to throw <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if the scheduler does not support the method for parameter object. The base instance of the priority scheduler is expected to throw <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> in every case. The <code>fireSchedulable</code> method has never worked, and its semantics are hard to clarify without significantly extending the semantics of schedulable objects. The method is not deprecated because the semantics of schedulable objects quite likely will be extended to make this method useful, but that goes beyond clarification.</p>
		<h4>SchedulingParameters</h4>
		<p><code>SchedulingParameters</code> now implements <code>Cloneable</code> and has a public <code>clone</code> method.</p>
		<p>The constructor is changed from public to protected.</p>
		<h4>PriorityParameters</h4>
		<p>No changes</p>
		<h4>ImportanceParameters</h4>
		<p>No changes</p>
		<h4>ProcessingGroupParameters</h4>
		<p><code>ProcessingGroupParameters</code> now implements <code>Cloneable</code> and has a public <code>clone</code> method</p>
		<h3>Deleted and Deprecated Methods</h3>
		<h4>PriorityScheduler</h4>
		<ol>
			<li><code>MAX_PRIORITY,</code> and <code>MIN_PRIORITY</code> are deprecated because they may bind the maximum and minimum priorities into an application at compile time and the available priority range is an attribute of the run-time platform.
		</ol>
		<h2>Memory Management</h2>
		<h3>New Methods and Signature Changes</h3>
		<h4>MemoryArea</h4>
		<p>The throws clause of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>newArray(Class type, int number)</code>
		</ul>
		<p>has been changed from<code>(IllegalAccessException InstantiationException)</code> to no exceptions to better reflect the checked exceptions thrown when the underlying platform creates a new array.</p>
		<p>The throws clause of:<code> </code></p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>newInstance(reflect.Constructor c, Object[] args)</code>
		</ul>
		<p>has been changed from<code>(IllegalAccessException InstantiationException)</code> to<b> </b><code>(IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException, InvocationTargetException)</code> to reflect the checked exceptions thrown when the underlying platform creates a new instance.</p>
		<p>The throws clause of:<code> </code></p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>newInstance(Class c)</code>
		</ul>
		<p>has been changed from<code>(IllegalAccessException InstantiationException)</code> to<b> </b><code>(IllegalAccessException, InstantiationException, NoSuchMethodException)</code> to reflect the checked exceptions thrown when the underlying platform creates a new instance.</p>
		<h4>HeapMemory</h4>
		<p>None</p>
		<h4>ImmortalMemory</h4>
		<p>The executeInArea method and the family of newInstance methods may be used by Java threads. Previously this was ambiguous, but since a Java thread can switch between heap and immortal without the full semantics of a scope stack, this limited access to RTSJ memory areas can be supported without modifying Java threads. Moreover, a mechanism to switch Java threads to &quot;immortal mode&quot; has always been implied by the memory area semantics of static initializers.</p>
		<h4>SizeEstimator</h4>
		<p>There was no way to estimate the size of an array object so</p>
		<p><code>public void reserveArray(int dimension)</code></p>
		<p>for arrays of references and</p>
		<p><code>public void reserveArray(int dimension, Class type)</code></p>
		<p>for arrays of primitive types were added.</p>
		<h4>ScopedMemory</h4>
		<p>The <code>getPortal()</code> method now throws the (unchecked) exceptions <code>MemoryAccessError</code> and <code>IllegalAssignmentError</code>. These exceptions were implicit in the existing reference and assignment rules, but the exact rules for generating them from this method were unclear. They are declared to make their possibility clear to the caller.</p>
		<p>The <code>ScopedCycleException</code> exception has been removed from the throws clause of the <code>joinAndEnter</code> methods that do not take a time parameter. There is no case where these methods need to throw that exception.</p>
		<p>The <code>joinAndEnter</code> methods are altered to throw <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> immediately when they have no non-null logic value. Previously, this behavior was ambiguous with the possibilities to either return immediately (as stated explicitly) or throw <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> as required to behave like indivisible <code>join</code> and <code>enter</code>.</p>
		<h4>LTMemory</h4>
		<p>Added four new constructors to simplify a common use case, and for symmetry with the <code>LTPhysicalMemory</code> class:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>LTMemory(long size)</code>
			<li><code>LTMemory(long size, Runnable logic)</code>
			<li><code>LTMemory(SizeEstimator size)</code>
			<li><code>LTMemory(SizeEstimator size, Runnable logic)</code>
		</ol>
		<h4>VTMemory</h4>
		<p>Added four new constructors to simplify a common use case, and for symmetry with the <code>VTPhysicalMemory</code> class:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>VTMemory(long size)</code>
			<li><code>VTMemory(long size, Runnable logic)</code>
			<li><code>VTMemory(SizeEstimator size)</code>
			<li><code>VTMemory(SizeEstimator size, Runnable logic)</code>
		</ol>
		<h4>PhysicalMemoryManager</h4>
		<p>The type of the <code>static final</code> fields <code>ALIGNED, BYTESWAP, SHARED</code>, and <code>DMA</code> is changed from <code>String</code> to <code>Object</code>. This is a compatible change that supports more flexibility of implementation.</p>
		<p>A new <code>static final</code> field, <code>IO_PAGE</code>, is added.</p>
		<p>The methods</p>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc"><code>public static void onInsertion(long base, long size, AsyncEvent ae)</code>
			<li type="disc"><code>public static void onRemoval(long base, long size, AsyncEvent ae)</code>
			<li type="disc"><code>public static boolean unregisterInsertionEvent(long base, long size, AsyncEvent ae)</code>
			<li type="disc"><code>public static boolean unregisterRemovalEvent(long base, long size, AsyncEvent ae)</code>
		</ul>
		<p>have been added to replace deprecated insertion and removal methods.</p>
		<p>All methods now throw <code>OffsetOutOfBoundsException</code> when the base is negative, and <code>SizeOutOfBoundsException</code> when the extent of memory passes the physical or virtual addressing boundary. This brings them in line with the methods in the classes commonly used by applications (such as <code>ImmortalPhysicalMemory</code>.)</p>
		<h4>PhysicalMemoryTypeFilter</h4>
		<p>The methods</p>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc"><code>public void onInsertion(long base, long size, AsyncEvent ae)</code>
			<li type="disc"><code>public void onRemoval(long base, long size, AsyncEvent ae)</code>
			<li type="disc"><code>public boolean unregisterInsertionEvent(long base, long size, AsyncEvent ae)</code>
			<li type="disc"><code>public boolean unregisterRemovalEvent(long base, long size, AsyncEvent ae)</code>
		</ul>
		<p>have been added to replace deprecated insertion and removal methods.</p>
		<p>All methods now throw <code>OffsetOutOfBoundsException</code> when the base is negative, and <code>SizeOutOfBoundsException</code> when the extent of memory passes the physical or virtual addressing boundary. This brings them in line with the methods in the classes commonly used by applications (such as <code>ImmortalPhysicalMemory</code>.)</p>
		<h4>RawMemoryAccess</h4>
		<p>The constructors for this class now specifically mention the possibility of <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>.</p>
		<h4>RawMemoryFloatAccess</h4>
		<p>The constructors for this class now specifically mention the possibility of <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>.</p>
		<h4>LTPhysicalMemory</h4>
		<p>None</p>
		<h4>VTPhysicalMemory</h4>
		<p>None</p>
		<h4>ImmortalPhysicalMemory</h4>
		<p>None</p>
		<h4>MemoryParameters</h4>
		<p>Changed <code>setAllocationRateIfFeasible()</code> to accept a <code>long</code> argument for consistency with all the other allocation rate methods that take and return <code>long</code>.</p>
		<p>The class now <code>implements Cloneable</code> and includes<code> public Object clone()</code></p>
		<h4>GarbageCollector</h4>
		<p>None</p>
		<h3>Deprecated Methods</h3>
		<p>The public constructor for the <code>GarbageCollector</code> is deprecated.</p>
		<p>The <code>onInsertion(long base, long size, AsyncEventHandler aeh)</code> and <code>onRemoval(long base, long size, AsyncEventHandler aeh)</code> methods in both <code>PhysicalMemoryManager</code> and <code>PhysicalMemoryTypeFilter</code> are deprecated in favor of new methods. The deprecated methods use async event handlers in a unnecessarily clumsy way (without an async event), and causing special argument values to unregister handlers is not good Java practice.</p>
		<h2><b>Synchronization</b></h2>
		<p>Significant changes have been made to the way priority ceiling protocol interacts with priority inheritance protocol.</p>
		<h3>New Methods and Signature Changes</h3>
		<p>Priority ceiling emulation was essentially unworkable as specified in the 1.0 spec. The 1.0.1 revision has semantics that can be implemented, but several changes to the APIs have been necessary.</p>
		<h4>MonitorControl</h4>
		<p>Made the constructor protected since <code>MonitorControl</code> is abstract, and each subclass should be a singleton.</p>
		<p>Changed both <code>setMonitorControl()</code> methods to return the old policy instead of returning <code>void</code>.</p>
		<h4>PriorityCeilingEmulation</h4>
		<p>Added<code> static PriorityCeilingEmulation instance(int ceiling</code>) to return a priority ceiling emulation object for each ceiling value. This lets the implementation check for equal ceilings by checking for equality of the object references.</p>
		<p>Added <code>getCeiling()</code> replacing <code>getDefaultCeiling</code>. The <code>getCeiling</code> method has the same semantics as <code>getDefaultCeiling</code>. The name, <code>getDefaultCeiling</code> is misleading because there is no value that can correctly be called the default ceiling.</p>
		<p>Added <code>static PriorityCeilingEmulation getMaxCeiling()</code> which returns a singleton universally usable priority ceiling emulation object. This object is usable in cases where an application wishes to make priority ceiling emulation the default monitor control policy.</p>
		<h4>PriorityInheritance</h4>
		<p>None</p>
		<h4>WaitFreeWriteQueue</h4>
		<p>There is little purpose for the reader and writer parameters for the constructor. The class can support multiple readers and writers, so these are at best hints. The constructor with the reader and writer parameters was retained, but two new constructors without those parameters were added to reduce the confusion caused by those parameters.</p>
		<p>Added the constructor <code>WaitFreeWriteQueue(int maximum) throws IllegalArgumentException</code></p>
		<p>Added the constructor <code>WaitFreeWriteQueue(int maximum, MemoryArea memory) throws IllegalArgumentException.</code></p>
		<p>Added <code>InterruptedException</code> to the <code>throws</code> clause of <code>read()</code>.</p>
		<h4>WaitFreeReadQueue</h4>
		<p>There is little purpose for the reader and writer parameters for the constructor. The class can support multiple readers and writers, so these are at best hints. The constructor with the reader and writer parameters was retained, but two new constructors without those parameters were added to reduce the confusion caused by those parameters.</p>
		<p>Added the constructor <code>WaitFreeReadQueue(int maximum, boolean notify) throws IllegalArgumentException</code></p>
		<p>Added the constructor <code>WaitFreeReadQueue(int maximum, MemoryArea memory, boolean notify) throws IllegalArgumentException</code></p>
		<p>Changed the return type of <code>write(Object object) from boolean </code>to<code> void </code>because the method could never return anything but <code>true,</code> and added <code>InterruptedException</code> to its <code>throws</code> clause because it is a general principle that all blocking methods should be interruptible.</p>
		<p>Added <code>InterruptedException</code> to the <code>throws</code> clause of <code>waitForData()</code> because it is a blocking method that should be interruptible.</p>
		<h4>WaitFreeDequeue</h4>
		<p>This class has been deprecated because it does not do anything that the separate <code>WaitFreeReadQueue</code> and <code>WaitFreeWriteQueue</code> do not do as well, and proper use of the proper <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> methods is unnecessarily confusing.</p>
		<p>Changed the return type of <code>blockingWrite(Object object) from boolean </code>to<code> void </code>because the method could never return anything but <code>true</code>.</p>
		<h3>Deleted and Deprecated Methods</h3>
		<p>The public constructors from the <code>PriorityCeilingEmulation</code> and <code>PriorityInheritance</code> classes have been removed. An implementation that exposes constructors for these methods as specified in version 1.0 would be needlessly complicated and it must leak immortal memory. The revised APIs require the implementation to produce (possibly lazily) singleton instances for each distinct value of the monitor control classes</p>
		<h4>PriorityCeilingEmulation</h4>
		<p>Removed the public constructor because this class is supposed to be able to generate a unique instance per ceiling value.</p>
		<p>Deprecated <code>getDefaultCeiling()</code> because the method name is misleading. The new <code>getCeiling</code> method should be used instead.</p>
		<h4>PriorityInheritance</h4>
		<p>Removed the public constructor because this is supposed to be a singleton.</p>
		<h2><b>Time</b></h2>
		<h3>New Methods and Signature Changes</h3>
		<h4>HighResolutionTime</h4>
		<p>Revised<code> RelativeTime relative(Clock clock, HighResolutionTime time)</code> to require a <code>RelativeTime</code> argument. Previously any <code>HighResolutionTime</code> argument was syntactically correct, but only <code>RelativeTime</code> could be used without causing the method to throw a runtime exception.</p>
		<p>There was no way to recover the clock property of a <code>HighResolutionTime</code> object, so the <code>getClock()</code> method was added. There are many ways to alter (re-associate) the clock, so no symmetrical<code> setClock()</code> method was required.</p>
		<p>The signature of <code>set(HighResolutionTime time)</code> is not changed, but its meaning is altered. Version 1.0 had it defined to set the value of the parameter to a value corresponding to the current date. This is completely at odds with Java conventions, and while the Javadoc in the reference implementation agrees with the 1.0 specification, the code alters the time value of <code>this</code> to match the parameter. The TCK was consistent with the RI code. The most likely conclusion is that the semantics for the method were a cut-and-paste error. The error is so surprising and potentially destructive that instead of deprecating the method (as would be normal for a case like this) the semantics were corrected to agree with the RI and TCK and set the millis and nanos values of <code>this</code> to the values from the parameter.</p>
		<p><code>HighResolution</code> time now implements <code>Cloneable</code>. It also has a public <code>clone</code> method and public <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code> methods that work correctly with <code>clone</code>.</p>
		<h4>AbsoluteTime</h4>
		<p>Added four new constructors that include the clock association:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>AbsoluteTime(Clock clock)</code>
			<li><code>AbsoluteTime(long millis, int nanos, Clock clock)</code>
			<li><code>AbsoluteTime(AbsoluteTime time, Clock clock)</code>
			<li><code>AbsoluteTime(java.util.Date date, Clock clock)</code>
		</ol>
		<p>Changed several methods that were specified as <code>final</code> to non-final. Some arithmetic methods were <code>final</code> and some were not with no discernible rationale for the difference. Changing them all to non-final was the most compatible way to resolve the inconsistency.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>add(RelativeTime time), </code>
			<li><code>subtract(AbsoluteTime time) </code>
			<li><code>subtract(AbsoluteTime time, RelativeTime destination) </code>
			<li><code>subtract(RelativeTime time) </code>
		</ul>
		<p>were specified as <code>final</code> and now have that attribute removed.</p>
		<p>One version of the <code>relative</code> method:</p>
		<p><code>RelativeTime relative&nbsp;(Clock clock, AbsoluteTime dest)</code></p>
		<p>could not be implemented as specified since it called for returning a <code>RelativeTime</code> value in an <code>AbsoluteTime</code> object. It was changed to:</p>
		<p><code>RelativeTime relative&nbsp;(Clock clock, RelativeTime dest)</code></p>
		<h4>RelativeTime</h4>
		<p>Added three new constructors that include the clock association:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>RelativeTime(Clock clock)</code>
			<li><code>RelativeTime(long millis, int nanos, Clock clock)</code>
			<li><code>RelativeTime(RelativeTime time, Clock clock)</code>
		</ol>
		<p>Changed two methods that were specified as <code>final</code> to non-final. Some arithmetic methods were <code>final</code> and some were not with no discernible rationale for the difference. Changing them all not non-final was the most compatible way to resolve the inconsistency.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>add(RelativeTime time)</code>
			<li><code>subtract(RelativeTime time)</code>
		</ul>
		<p>were specified as<code> final </code>and now have that attribute removed.</p>
		<h4>RationalTime</h4>
		<p>None. The class is deprecated.</p>
		<h3>Deprecated Methods</h3>
		<h4>HighResolutionTime</h4>
		<p><code>none</code>.</p>
		<h4>RelativeTime</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><code>getInterarrivalTime(), </code>
			<li><code>getInterarrivalTime(RelativeTime destination)</code>, and
			<li><code>addInterarrivalTo(AbsoluteTime timeAndDestination)</code>
		</ul>
		<p>are deprecated because their only purpose is to support the deprecated <code>RationalTime</code> class.</p>
		<h3>Deprecated Classes</h3>
		<h4>RationalTime</h4>
		<p>The <code>RationalTime</code> class was defined so it has two reasonable and incompatible descriptions. Neither of them can be implemented well. We have deprecated the class and hope to revisit the underlying concepts and abstract them better in a future revision.</p>
		<h2><b>Clocks and Timers</b></h2>
		<h3>New Methods and Signature Changes</h3>
		<h4>Clock</h4>
		<p>Added <code>RelativeTime getEpochOffset() throws UnsupportedOperationException</code> to let applications compare clocks with different epochs, and to let them discover clocks that have no concept of an epoch.</p>
		<p>Changed the return type of <code>getTime(AbsoluteTime time)</code> from <code>void</code> to <code>AbsoluteTime</code> to make the method consistent with the RTSJ conventions of returning a reference to the destination parameter when it is provided. This is also required to give it consistent behavior when a null parameter is passed.</p>
		<h4>Timer</h4>
		<p>The <code>fire()</code> method inherited from <code>AsyncEventHandler</code> is now overridden in this class since this is the most appropriate place to note that it throws <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if the class is <code>Timer.</code></p>
		<p>The <code>void start(boolean disabled) throws IllegalStateException</code> method has been added because without such a method there would be no way to start a timer in the disabled state that does not have a possible race condition.</p>
		<p>Added new method:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>public AbsoluteTime getFireTime(AbsoluteTime fireTime)</code>
		</ol>
		<h4>OneShotTimer</h4>
		<p>No changes except those inherited from <code>Timer</code>.</p>
		<h4>PeriodicTimer</h4>
		<p>No changes except those inherited from <code>Timer</code>.</p>
		<h2><b>Asynchrony</b></h2>
		<h3>New Methods and Signature Changes</h3>
		<h4>AsyncEventHandler</h4>
		<p>Two methods were defined as <code>final</code> with no justification when compared to other methods in the same class that were not final:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>getAndClearPendingFireCount</code>
			<li><code>getPendingFireCount</code>
		</ol>
		<p>Their <code>final</code> attribute was removed to make them consistent with other similar methods.</p>
		<p>Two new methods were added:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>boolean isDaemon()</code>
			<li><code>void setDaemon(boolean on)</code>
		</ol>
		<p>To control the &quot;daemon nature&quot; of the AEH.</p>
		<p>The two methods added to the <code>Schedulable</code> interface are also added here.</p>
		<h4>AsyncEvent</h4>
		<p>None.</p>
		<h4>BoundAsyncEventHandler</h4>
		<p>The <code>BoundAsyncEventHandler</code> class is no longer an <code>abstract</code> class. Since the class includes a constructor with a <code>logic</code> parameter, it could operate without being subclassed. There was no reason it should be abstract, and leaving it abstract was inconvenient for application developers.</p>
		<h4>Interruptible</h4>
		<p>None</p>
		<h4>AsynchronouslyInterruptedException</h4>
		<p>Added the boolean <code>clear()</code> method to implement the safe semantics of <code>happened()</code>, but not offer to secretly throw AIE.</p>
		<h4>Timed</h4>
		<p>None.</p>
		<h3>Deprecated Methods</h3>
		<h4>AsynchronouslyInterruptedException</h4>
		<p>Deprecated <code>happened() and propagate()</code>. These methods are defined to throw the <code>AsynchronouslyInterruptedException</code> and they do not include that <em>checked</em> exception in their throws clauses. They may be actively dangerous to methods up their call chain that are not expecting an exception, but the danger is not bad enough to justify deleting these methods without warning.</p>
		<p>An application can achieve the effect of <code>propagate</code> by throwing an AIE after it catches it, and it can achieve the effect of <code>happened</code> by combining the new <code>clear()</code> method with fire.</p>
		<h2><b>System and Options</b></h2>
		<h4><b>POSIXSignalHandler</b></h4>
		<p>Deprecated many signal names that are not found in the POSIX 9945-1-1996 standard:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>SIGCANCEL,
			<li>SIGFREEZE,
			<li>SIGIO,
			<li>SIGLOST,
			<li>SIGWP,
			<li>SIGPOLL,
			<li>SIGPROF,
			<li>SIGPWR,
			<li>SIGTHAW,
			<li>SIGURG,
			<li>SIGVTALRM,
			<li>SIGWAITING,
			<li>SIGWINCH,
			<li>SIGXCPU, and
			<li>SIGXFSZ.
		</ul>
		<p>Removed the default no-arg constructor leaving the class with no public constructor.</p>
		<h4><b>RealtimeSecurity</b></h4>
		<p>Added methods</p>
		<p><code>public void checkSetMonitorControl(MonitorControl policy) throws SecurityException</code></p>
		<p>and</p>
		<p><code>public void checkSetDaemon() throws SecurityException</code></p>
		<p>because the specification already says that these operations are checked by the security manager.</p>
		<h4><b>RealtimeSystem</b></h4>
		<p>The no-arg constructor was an artifact of javadoc. Since this class's implementation is entirely static, the constructor is pointless and has been removed.</p>
		<p>If applications execute the method call, <code>System.getProperty(&quot;javax.realtime.version&quot;),</code> the return value will be a string of the form, &quot;x.y.z&quot;. Where 'x' is the major version number and 'y' and 'z' are minor version numbers. These version numbers state to which version of the RTSJ the underlying implementation claims conformance. The first release of the RTSJ, dated 11/2001, is numbered as, 1.0.0. Since this property is required in only subsequent releases of the RTSJ implementations of the RTSJ which intend to conform to 1.0.0 may return the String &quot;1.0.0&quot; or null.</p>
		<p>Added <code>getInitialMonitorControl()</code> to support the monitor control classes.</p>
		<h2><b>Exceptions</b></h2>
		<h3><b>Added Classes</b></h3>
		<p>Added the class <code>ArrivalTimeQueueOverflowException </code>to indicate overflow of an async event handlers arrival queue, and<code> CeilingViolationException </code>to signify that a thread has attempted to lock a priority ceiling lock when its base priority exceeds the priority of the lock.</p>
		<h3>Changed Classes</h3>
		<p>The following exceptions have been changed from checked to unchecked:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>MemoryScopeException</code>
			<li><code>InnaccessibleAreaException</code>
			<li><code>MemoryTypeConflictException</code>
			<li><code>MITViolationException</code>
			<li><code>OffsetOutOfBoundsException</code>
			<li><code>SizeOutOfBoundsException</code>
			<li><code>UnsupportedPhysicalMemoryException</code>
		</ul>
		<p>Each of these exceptions is characteristic of a programming error, not a fault that a programmer should anticipate and handle.</p>
