<h1>Exceptions</h1>
                <p>This section contains exceptions defined by the RTSJ.  These exception classes:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Provide additional exception classes required for other sections of this specification.<li>Provide the ability to asynchronously transfer the control of program logic (see <a href="javax/realtime/AsynchronouslyInterruptedException.html"><code>AsynchronouslyInterruptedException</code></a>.)
                </ul>
                <h2>Semantics and Requirements</h2>
                <p>This list establishes the semantics and requirements that are applicable across the classes of this section. Semantics that apply to particular classes, constructors, methods, and fields will be found in the class description and the constructor, method, and field detail sections.</p>
                <ol>
                        <li>All classes in this section are required.
                        <li>All exceptions, except <tt>AsynchronouslyInterruptedException</tt>, are required to have semantics exactly as those of their eventual superclass in the <tt>java.*</tt> hierarchy.
                </ol>
                <p>The <code>AsynchronouslyInterruptedException </code>class is not included in this chapter. It is more closely related to asynchronous operation than to exception handling and so can be found in the <a href="async_overview-summary.html">Asynchrony</a> chapter.</p>
                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                <p>The need for additional exceptions given the new semantics added by the other sections of this specification is obvious. That the specification attaches new, nontraditional, exception semantics to <tt>AsynchronouslyInterruptedException</tt> is, perhaps, not so obvious. However, after careful thought, and given our self-imposed directive that only well-defined code blocks would be subject to having their control asynchronously transferred, the chosen mechanism is logical.</p>
